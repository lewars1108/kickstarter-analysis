# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is looking to start a Kickstater to fund her play Fever. A dataset of over 4000 fundraising campaigns were examined to help Louise make important decisions for a successful and realistic crowd funding plan. The data was filtered to only include the plays subcategory. Outcomes, goals, and pledges were examined to find correlations between the variable. Launches and end dates were also reviewed to determine is the duration of the fundraiser had an effect on the outcome.


### Purpose
This data analysis was used to help Louise make important decisions about her Kickstarter campaign to fund her play Fever.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I ran into some issues with the =COUNTIF formula mainly due to syntax. I double checked my numbers by filtering on the Kickstarter sheet, and if they did not match my =COUNTIF numbers I reviewed my syntax and argument numbers to get the correct numbers.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? <br>Campaigns tend to be more successful in the summer months starting in May. Campaigns tend to be less successfuil in the fall and winter months.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? <br>Plays with goals between $1000 and $500 have the highest number of successful Kickstarters.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? <br> A larger sample size could be more beneficial for our analysis and we could analyze a variety of crowdsourcing companies to draw more significant insights.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
